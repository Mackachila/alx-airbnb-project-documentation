# User Stories

This directory contains the core user stories for the **ALX Airbnb Project**. These stories are derived from the project's use case diagram and represent key interactions between system users (Guests, Hosts, and Admins) and the platform.

## Purpose

User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the end user. They help guide development by focusing on user needs and ensuring the software provides real value.

## Contents

- `user-stories.md`: A markdown file containing at least five foundational user stories based on the use case diagram. These stories serve as the starting point for feature development.
